# Visualisation-Project
This project is a part of my course on Visualization. In this project, I have created an RMarkdown report using the 2015 Police Killings dataset. I have included several interactive graphs and visualizations where one can toggle highlighted parameters, such as race/ethnicity, cause of death, and armed status, in various combinations to generate multiple graphs. These visualizations enable users to look at a visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on police killings and their demographic trends, uncovering key insights into racial disparities and geographic patterns of incidents.
